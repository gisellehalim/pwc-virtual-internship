Dear Mr. Engagement Partner,

I'm writing to share some key findings from my analysis of customer churn.

Key Findings:

Tenure: I observed a strong correlation between shorter subscription periods (< 1 year) and higher churn rates. This suggests that customers who sign up for shorter terms are more likely to cancel their service.
Service Type: Fiber optic internet and phone service experience the highest churn rates compared to other services offered. High price might be one of the factors causing customer churn.
Payment Method: Customers using electronic checks and paperless billing have a significantly higher churn rate compared to other payment methods.
Customer Complaints: A majority of churning customers have filed at least one tech ticket, suggesting dissatisfaction with the service or technology.

Recommendations:

Based on these findings, I recommend focusing on the following areas:

Develop strategies to retain customers with shorter subscriptions. This could involve offering incentives like discounts or loyalty programs for longer commitments.
Investigate the reasons behind the high churn rates in fiber optic internet and phone service. This might involve analyzing customer feedback, service performance metrics, or competitor offerings.
Give discounts or promotions to retain customers that are in risk of churning.
Further investigate the link between electronic check payments, paperless billing and churn. Analyze customer demographics and explore reasons for this correlation.
Prioritize improving the technology and service quality. Addressing customer complaints and ensuring smooth service delivery can significantly reduce churn.

I believe these recommendations will help us develop a comprehensive strategy to address customer churn and improve customer retention across all service types and payment methods.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Giselle
